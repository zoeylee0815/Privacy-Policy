Privacy Policy

Random Generator App is a Google Play Developer handle primarily operated by kenzo, which provides Android apps.

This page is used to inform app users regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information for anyone who decides to use our services.

Information Collection and Use

For some of our apps, we may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information, including, but not limited to, your name, phone number, and contacts information.
